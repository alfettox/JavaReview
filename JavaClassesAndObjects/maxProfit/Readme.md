### Stock Trading Algorithm Explanation
This Java program implements an algorithm for maximizing profit in stock trading based on historical closing prices. The algorithm identifies the best buying and selling points within the given historical data to achieve the highest profit.

#### Problem Statement
Given an array of historical closing prices for a stock, the goal is to find the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling the stock on different days. The algorithm should consider the constraint that the selling day must come after the buying day.

#### Algorithm Explanation
Edge Case Handling:

Check for edge cases where the input array is null or has less than 2 elements. In such cases, return 0 as there are not enough prices to calculate a profit.
Initialization:

Initialize two variables: minPrice to track the minimum price encountered so far and maxProfit to track the maximum profit.
Set the initial value of minPrice to the first element in the closing prices array, and maxProfit to 0.
Iterative Loop:

Iterate through the array of closing prices starting from the second element.
For each day, compare the current closing price with the minPrice.
Update the minPrice to be the smaller of the current minPrice and the current closing price.
Calculate the potential profit if selling at the current price (currentPrice - minPrice).
Update maxProfit to be the larger of the current maxProfit and the potential profit.
Result:

After the iteration, maxProfit holds the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying at the lowest price and selling at the highest price within the given historical data.
Example

```
    public class Main {
    public static int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
    // Edge case
    if (prices == null || prices.length < 2) {
    return 0;
    }
    
            int minPrice = prices[0];
            int maxProfit = 0;
    
            // Iterative Loop
            for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
                int currentPrice = prices[i];
                minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, currentPrice);
                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, currentPrice - minPrice);
            }
    
            return maxProfit;
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            int[] closingPrices = {10, 20, 13, 24, 9};
            int result = maxProfit(closingPrices);
            System.out.println("Maximum Profit: " + result);
        }
    }
```
In this example, the algorithm iterates through the array of closing prices, updating minPrice and maxProfit at each step. The final result is the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling within the given historical data. For the provided closingPrices array, the output will be "Maximum Profit: 14".
